; Prompt:
;
; Write a procedure named CountNearMatches that receives pointers to two arrays
; of signed doublewords, a parameter that indicates the length of the two
; arrays, and a parameter that indicates the maximum allowed difference
; (called diff) between any two matching elements. For each element x(i) in the
; Ô¨Årst array, if the difference between it and the corresponding y(i) in the
; second array is less than or equal to diff, increment a count. At the end,
; return a count of the number of nearly matching array elements in EAX.
; Display this value.

; Write a test program that calls CountNearMatches and passes pointers to two
; different pairs of arrays. Use the INVOKE statement to call your procedure
; and pass stack parameters. Create a PROTO declaration for CountMatches. Save
; and restore any registers (other than EAX) changed by your procedure.
